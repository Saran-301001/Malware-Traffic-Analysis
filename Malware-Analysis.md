When I download a pcap file its look like doing some fishy Activity. 

Hmm, I try to get the **Hashes** of the **Pcap** file I have Download.

Using [**Virus total**](https://www.virustotal.com/) try to figure out whether it's malware or not.

Yes my Doubt was correct. 

It's a malware "Trojan" and some HTTP for File transfer I guess.

But I clearly Dont Know what is inside the PCAP I want to look deeper to get clear understanding of an malware. 

So I just the **PCAP** file in wireshark.

Next I just try to get the statistics of pacap. Obviously it must some HTTP thing that we saw before. 

The Hierarchy statistics gives the result **98% ipv4** & **96% TCP**(Transmission Control Protocol).

Interesting, so it must be some web-based malware like for Backdoor or Ransomeware.

So, I just saw all the **HTTP** request for some interesting stuffs.

Yea,So many get request and some commonly used site like:www.bing.com and some are Unknown malicious site. 

So I am almost done.

Now I need to Analysis these http servers

Yea it might be an Malware or its an Common file.

So I Downloaded those files. 

And Extract file Hashes from those files.

 I got some **MD5** **hashes** of the file. 
 
 Then scanned those hashes in virustotal.
 
 And the Result is.
